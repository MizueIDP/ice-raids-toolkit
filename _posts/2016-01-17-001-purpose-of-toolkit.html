title:  "Purpose of Toolkit"
chapter: 1
preface: This toolkit is a collaboration between the Immigrant Defense Project (IDP) and the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), and a culmination of our collective work against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) home raids during the G.W. Bush and Obama administrations. It aims to help advocates prepare for fighting back against ICE raids during the Trump administration.

In 2013, IDP and CCR, along with the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama (HICA), filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request on DHS and ICE’s controversial tactic of arresting immigrants at their homes, often without judicial warrants.<sup>1</sup>  We are still litigating the FOIA, but have received some information on the recent history of ICE trainings and practices around home raids. These materials include internal memos and training manuals that we have included in the Appendix.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, IDP has monitored and tracked ICE raids, primarily in the New York City area, for three years. After reviewing over two hundred reports of ICE activity, we have identified the key tactics used by ICE in recent years to arrest people at homes and in the community.

In this toolkit, we have assembled our research from the FOIA and monitoring of home raids to support community defense against ICE’s deportation dragnet. It contains information on: (1) who ICE targets for deportation; (2) where and how ICE locates people in communities; and (3) ICE arrest tactics during raids. We also include ideas on how to fight back against these abusive practices that destroy the fabric and safety of communities, emergency preparedness resources for those at risk of deportation, and possible legal
and community challenges for those who have experienced raids.

ICE raids are one piece of a vast deportation apparatus that the federal government that has built up in recent decades to help ICE meet "performance goals" <sup>3</sup> and deport as many people as possible. It is clear from our research that many of the specific tactics ICE agents currently employ during raids are legacies of past practices that have shifted and changed shape with the political tide, successful legal challenges and significant protest. Despite public claims of change, there is a lot that remains the same. The agency  has demonstrated at best, an indifference to community members’ constitutional rights — particularly when left to their own devices — and have shown little interest in internal accountability for misconduct. Under the new administration, we expect ICE to resurrect some of its past problematic tactics and can learn from successful challenges advocates mounted previously.

Based on our historical research, the FOIA production, and local tracking of raids, we have identified the following key lessons:

* Throughout both the G.W. Bush and Obama administrations, ICE has institutionalized a militaristic approach to civil arrests with little regard
for constitutional principles or violations.

* Despite proactive litigation that resulted in significant damages settlements and improved training materials for agents and officers during the G.W. Bush and Obama administrations, ICE continues to illegally enter and search homes without proper warrants through deceptive ruses, such as pretending to be local police, and the use of threats and violent force.

* Even though DHS claims to engage in "targeted enforcement," ICE’s deceptive and violent home raid tactics often have traumatic impacts on people who are not the target, including children, as residents are frequently present during raids.

* ICE relies on widespread surveillance and deception to arrest people outside of their homes, on the street, in the courts and in government-run spaces like homeless shelters.

* ICE’s definition of a "public safety threat" includes a wide range of people — including people with serious medical and mental health issues, those with decades-old convictions, and those who never served time in jail.

* With a possible return to the more abusive, unconstitutional tactics ICE used under G.W. Bush, it is helpful to revisit and consider successful strategies from the past — like strategic litigation — as communities create
a new, adaptable toolbox for fighting back against raids.

The infrastructure that has been created in recent decades will become the baseline for what Trump’s administration can execute in its quest to deport millions of people. The key elements include the constellation of a massive police force, a further militarized southern border, surveillance, expansive data-sharing between local police and ICE, and the maintenance of a sprawling network of prisons <sup>4</sup> for immigrants. The success of this apparatus relies on decades of extensive criminalization that impacts all communities of color — including racialized policing, discriminatory prosecution and harsh sentencing, and mass imprisonment.

As we develop strategies to fight back against Trump’s promise to immediately deport millions of people, it is critical to draw lessons from the struggles against the system of mass deportation and criminalization that has expanded over the past decades. This toolkit will address the need for details about previous and ongoing tactics the federal government has used to deport people from their communities. It also proposes some possible strategies to prepare for what may come in the months and years ahead.
